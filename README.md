# Garage-Sale-Matchmaker

Purpose: Read through a list of items from a txt file to match sellers and buyers in a community garage sale. 

Description: This C++ program built in sublime and run through the command line is passed a txt file containing a list of 5 item types (bike, microwave, dresser, truck, or chicken), whether they are wanted or for sale, and their list/max price. Once the txt file is specified in the command line, the program runs through the list, searching for matches between buyers and sellers. If a match is found, it is printed. If a match is not found, it is added to an array and printed after the matches. 

Running: The program can be run by typing ./HW1_Connor_Humiston followed by a space and the txt file name that contains the garage sale items.
	For example:
		./HW1_Connor_Humiston garageSale.txt where garageSale.txt is the file name
